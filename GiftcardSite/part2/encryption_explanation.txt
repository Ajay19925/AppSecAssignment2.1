Encrypting the Database:
-----------------------

	Encrypting DB fields (Implementation):
	
	For Database field encryption, I used a library called 'django-cryptography' (https://pypi.org/project/django-cryptography/). Using this library we can encrypt database fields using the API method.

	Installation and Testing:
		- pip install django-cryptography (Run the command to use the library)
		- I encrypted the field 'data' in table 'Legacysite_card' by making code changes (data field will have information about gift card - sensitive info)
		- I made certain changes in 'GiftcardSite\LegacySite\models.py' file to achieve the encryption.
		- I queried the database to confirm whether the encryption was successful. 
		- Please refer screenshot in '\GiftcardSite\part2\data_field_encryption.png' for the outcome.

	Code Changes:
		- Add 'from django_cryptography.fields import encrypt' on 'GiftcardSite\LegacySite\models.py' file
		- Replace 'data = models.BinaryField(unique=True)' (line 40) by 'data = encrypt(models.BinaryField(unique=True))'
