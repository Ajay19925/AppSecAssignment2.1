Encrypting the Database:
-----------------------

Encrypting DB fields (Implementation):
	
	For Database field encryption, I used a library called 'django-cryptography' (https://pypi.org/project/django-cryptography/). Using this library we can encrypt database fields using the API method.

	Installation and Testing:
		- pip install django-cryptography (Run the command to use the library)
		- I encrypted the field 'data' in table 'Legacysite_card' by making code changes (data field will have information about gift card - sensitive info)
		- I made certain changes in 'GiftcardSite\LegacySite\models.py' file to achieve the encryption.
		- I queried the database to confirm whether the encryption was successful. 
		- Please refer screenshot in '\GiftcardSite\part2\data_field_encryption.png' for the outcome.

	Code Changes:
		- Add 'from django_cryptography.fields import encrypt' on 'GiftcardSite\LegacySite\models.py' file
		- Replace 'data = models.BinaryField(unique=True)' (line 40) by 'data = encrypt(models.BinaryField(unique=True))' 

Key management (Implementation):

	I found a 'SECRET_KEY' in 'GiftcardSite\GiftcardSite\settings.py' file. For testing purposes I commented 'SECRET_KEY = 'kmgysa#fz+9(z1*=c0ydrjizk*7sthm2ga1z4=^61$cxcq8b$l'' (line 24) on the settings file and executed the site. I received some errors. From the error and internet surfing, I found that 'This value [the SECRET_KEY setting] is the key to securing signed data â€“ it is vital you keep this secure, or attackers could use it to generate their own signed values.'
	We prefer not to store our key on the same server.	

	Approach, Implementation and Testing:
		- My approach is to store the secret key in the environment variable and make use of it in the application.
		- Set the environmental variable using 'export SECRET_KEY='kmgysa#fz+9(z1*=c0ydrjizk*7sthm2ga1z4=^61$cxcq8b$l''
		- Whenever the server is rebooted or restarted, we need to set this environmental variable in the server.
		- In 'GiftcardSite\GiftcardSite\settings.py' file we can access the SECRET_KEY from the environmental variable.
		- Make changes to the GithubActions file to add the environmental variable on startup.

	Code Changes:
		- Remove 'SECRET_KEY = 'kmgysa#fz+9(z1*=c0ydrjizk*7sthm2ga1z4=^61$cxcq8b$l'' from 'GiftcardSite\GiftcardSite\settings.py' (line 24)
		- Add 'SECRET_KEY=os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')' on 'GiftcardSite\GiftcardSite\settings.py' file
